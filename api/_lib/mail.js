/* =========================================================================================
   EMAIL, AS A COURTESY ON TOP OF THE IMPREST REGISTER -- never as the thing it depends on.
   =========================================================================================
     "so the gm and administrator email get set in settings" (hoop-pmo, the same pattern)

   The imprest panes are the system of record: a request exists the moment its row does, and
   the GM sees it the moment they open Idhini ya imprest. Email is the nudge that says "there
   is something to decide" and, now, a way to decide it without opening the portal at all. So
   it MUST NOT be able to break the thing it is announcing: a request that failed because a
   mail provider was down, or because nobody had set an address yet, would be a request lost
   to a courtesy.

   Every function here therefore RESOLVES, always, with { sent, reason }. The caller records
   the answer (the pane says "email haikutumwa" beside a request nobody was told about) and
   carries on. Nothing here throws.

   SAME PROVIDER AND THE SAME TWO KNOBS AS THE WEEKLY EXPECTED-DEFAULTERS EMAIL
   (emailWeeklyExpdf in portal-core.js), deliberately, so one deploy variable serves both:
     RESEND_API_KEY   environment variable on the deployment -- a secret, so never a settings row
     EMAIL_FROM       Settings; blank falls back to Resend's own onboarding sender, which Resend
                      delivers ONLY to the address of the Resend account itself -- enough to see
                      the first test arrive, useless for the office. Set a sender on a domain
                      verified in Resend before anybody relies on it.
   That function has its own inline copy of this fetch, written before this file existed; this
   is the same pattern, pulled out so a second feature (Imprest) does not grow a third copy --
   "one definition of a rule, in one place" (CLAUDE.md). The recipient is a Settings KEY passed
   by the caller (IMPREST_GM_EMAIL) so the office can change who is told without a deploy.
   Several addresses may be separated by commas or semicolons. */

/* BOUNDED, because the row is already written by the time a send runs. A provider that accepts
   the connection and then hangs would hold the serverless function open past its limit, and
   the response that says "filed" would never reach the phone. Eight seconds is longer than any
   real send and well short of the function's own budget. */
