/** Supabase/PostgREST caps any single query at 1000 rows by default -- silently, no error, just
    a truncated result. This is exactly what made two different tables both report precisely
    1000 on the dashboard regardless of their real row counts. Fetches ALL matching rows by
    paginating with .range() until a page comes back short of a full page (the sign nothing's
    left). Takes a function that BUILDS the query, not a query object -- .range() needs to apply
    to a fresh copy each page, not a query that's already been sent. */
/** Pages until a short page arrives -- ONE PAGE AT A TIME, deliberately.

    A wave of six concurrent page requests was tried and reverted the same day. It made each
    individual read finish sooner, but every screen fires several of these at once, and with
    200+ users on a live system the multiplied concurrency exhausted the database's connection
    pool: logins started failing with "failed to fetch", Settings would not open, and the
    data-heavy tabs errored. Latency per read is a smaller problem than the whole system
    falling over, so this stays sequential.

    The real fix for a slow read is to ask for FEWER ROWS AND FEWER COLUMNS, which is what the
    narrowed selects do -- not to ask for the same excess faster. */
/* FEWER, BIGGER PAGES -- not more of them at once.

   Asking for a thousand rows at a time meant thirty separate journeys to the database for one
   snapshot of thirty thousand customers, each one a full HTTPS round trip from Vercel. The
   dashboard needed 567 of them. At 150ms apiece that is eighty-five seconds of waiting before
   a single figure is worked out, and the platform gives up at sixty.

   The fix is NOT to fire them in parallel -- that was tried and it took the whole system down
   (see above). It is to make each journey carry more. Ten thousand rows in one request costs
   barely more than one thousand: the same round trip, a bigger body.

   PostgREST may be configured with a lower ceiling than we ask for, and it enforces it
   SILENTLY -- a truncated page with no error, which is what once made two different tables
   both report exactly 1000. So the ceiling is LEARNED rather than assumed: if the first page
   comes back at a round number below what was asked for, that number becomes the page size for
   the rest of this read, and paging continues correctly from there. Asking for more than the
   server allows is therefore safe, and asking for less than it allows is just slow. */

/* =====================================================================================
   A PAGED READ NEEDS A TOTAL ORDER, OR THE PAGES DO NOT FIT TOGETHER.
   =====================================================================================
   Reported from the field, and it is the most corrosive kind of bug there is:

     "The dashboard reads different stats after every visit or refresh without even any
      update being uploaded."

   Nothing was being uploaded and nothing was random in our arithmetic. The randomness was in
   the DATABASE, and it is documented behaviour rather than a fault.

   `offset`/`limit` slice a result set by POSITION. Postgres only promises a position when the
   query says ORDER BY -- without one it is free to hand rows back in whatever order the plan
   happens to produce, and that order is not stable between two separate statements. It is
   least stable on exactly the tables this matters for: `synchronize_seqscans` is on by default,
   so a sequential scan over a big table starts wherever another scan already in flight has got
   to, and finishes by wrapping round. Two users refreshing at once therefore get two DIFFERENT
   orderings of the same unchanged rows.

   Page 1 is then rows 0-9,999 of one ordering and page 2 is rows 10,000-19,999 of a different
   one. Some customers arrive twice and others not at all -- so the total moves every refresh,
   by a plausible-looking amount, with no error anywhere and nothing in the data to blame. It
   also explains the shape of the complaint that came with it: figures that look "abnormal"
   rather than obviously broken.

   The fix is to give every paged read a tiebreaker on a column that is UNIQUE, which pins the
   ordering down completely. It is added AFTER whatever the caller already ordered by, so the
   caller's own sort still decides and this only settles the ties -- which is the only place
   the ambiguity ever was.

   COST. Sorting is not free, but it is small next to what these reads already do: a sort of ten
   thousand rows costs a few milliseconds, against the tens of milliseconds it takes merely to
   serialise them and put them on the wire. Where the tiebreaker is the primary key, Postgres can
   often walk the index and not sort at all.

   IF THE SERVER WILL NOT ACCEPT THE ORDER -- an un-migrated table that has no `id` yet, a view,
   a column renamed -- the read falls back to exactly what it did before: unordered, one page at
   a time. A tiebreaker that cannot be applied must never turn a working screen into an error. */
