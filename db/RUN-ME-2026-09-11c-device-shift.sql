--  RUN ME.  MOVING A HANDSET TO THE OTHER COMPANY -- three columns, nothing else.
-- =====================================================================================
--
--    "another button for shift so that hoop can shift a device to hope and viceversa
--     saving re-enlorrment energy"
--
--  Paste the WHOLE FILE into the Supabase SQL editor and run it once. Safe to re-run:
--  every statement is `add column if not exists`, so a second run changes nothing.
--
--  UNTIL THIS RUNS, SHIFT SIMPLY DOES NOTHING -- not fails, does nothing. deviceShift
--  writes these three columns; deviceApi's beat() and byToken() both read them with a
--  pre-migration fallback, exactly like every other device column added after the first
--  register migration. A handset asks its usual questions, gets its usual answers, and
--  never hears about a shift that was never written down.
--
--  WHAT THESE HOLD. `shift_server` and `shift_batch` are the order sitting on a row:
--  which other office this handset should move to, and the batch token (minted by THAT
--  office's own Sajili simu / Enrol) it will use to prove itself there. The handset reads
--  them on its next beat and clears them itself once the claim lands -- see Shift.java in
--  the app and `shifted` in api/_lib/device-core.js, which is what a departing handset
--  calls to tell THIS office it left. `shift_at` is stamped for the same reason enrol_batch
--  carries one: so a stale order sitting unconfirmed for weeks is a fact the register can
--  show, not a silent question mark.
